Turtle Crossing Game...You might've played Crossy Road. So this is a similar concept. 
We have a whole bunch of cars going across a super busy multilane highway and turtle is the player who has to cross the road.  

The player controls the turtle, which only go forwards, and there's a whole bunch of randomly generated cars which are going horizontally across the screen. 
Now, once a player reaches the other side of the screen, the cars speed up, but the player goes back to the starting position, ready to cross the screen again. 
Now, at some point when the player turtle hits a car, then that is game over.
